Description: SGC is a semi-supervised pipeline for gene clustering in gene co-expression networks.
             SGC consists of multiple novel steps that enable the computation of highly enriched modules 
             in an unsupervised manner. But unlike all existing frameworks, it further incorporates a 
             novel step that leverages Gene Ontology information in a semi-supervised clustering method 
             that further improves the quality of the computed modules.
